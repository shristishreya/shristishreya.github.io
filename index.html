PM Intern@<a href="https://animall.in/">Animall</a></h5>
<p style="color:black">
Hey!! I'm a senior year undergrad and an aspring product manager. I'm intrigued by the chance of cross functionality associated with this role. I come with some background in product growth(at <a href="https://www.supergaming.com/">Supergaming</a>), applied machine learning(at <a href="https://www.atree.org/">ATREE</a> & <a href="https://www.icarda.org/">ICARDA</a>) and an interest in UI/UX designing.</p>
<p>Since you are here have a look at some of my same work below:</p>
<ul>
<p>While my time at Bored, I did a review of other apps working in the same domain i.e empathy increasing tools for remote teams which you can find here and reviewed their websites talking about the likable part in their UI/UX design that we could use as lead, that you can see here.
HOT OSM:  I did employee surveys for them which involved me talking to their remote employees about how the feedback system works, are they satisfied or what changes they would like to see. And finally making my recommendations. You can see it here. 
Wealth42: Made UI/UX changes for their financial goal planning tool and also designed a few linkedin flyers and twitter threads for them. 
ATREE(Google summer of earth engine program): Worked on a project on mapping of invasive species using google earth engine. Developed a machine learning model and presented the final work at IALE North America conference that was held in Toronto. You can find the paper here.
